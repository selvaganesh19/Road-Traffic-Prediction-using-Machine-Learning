# Web Machine Learning Application

This project is a web application that utilizes a machine learning model to provide predictions based on user input. The application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Flask that serves the model.

## Project Structure

```

├── frontend
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML file for the frontend
│   ├── css
│   │   └── style.css    # Styles for the frontend
│   └── js
│       └── script.js     # JavaScript code for user interactions
├── backend
│   ├── app.py           # Flask application for serving the model
│   ├── model.h5        # Trained machine learning model
│   └── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies for the backend
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-ml-app
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend:**
   - Open the `frontend/index.html` file in a web browser to access the application.

## Usage

- Interact with the frontend to input data for predictions.
- The frontend will communicate with the backend to retrieve predictions from the machine learning model.
