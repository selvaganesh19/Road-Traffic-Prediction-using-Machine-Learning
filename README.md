# 🚦 Road-Traffic-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Predict road traffic patterns using powerful machine learning techniques. This project provides tools and models to forecast traffic congestion, helping optimize routes, reduce delays, and enhance urban mobility.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: Implements a range of machine learning models for robust traffic prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for cleaning and transforming raw traffic data.
- **Visualization Tools**: Insightful plots to analyze traffic trends and model performance.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new models or data sources.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple scripts to train, evaluate, and predict.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Road-Traffic-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Road-Traffic-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Prepare your data**  
   Place your traffic data in the `data/` directory or update the configuration files as needed.

2. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
   ```

3. **Make predictions**
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_traffic_data.csv
   ```

4. **Visualize results**
   ```bash
   python visualize.py --results results/predictions.csv
   ```

*For detailed usage and all available options, refer to the [documentation](docs/USAGE.md) (if available).*

# Web Machine Learning Application

This project is a web application that utilizes a machine learning model to provide predictions based on user input. The application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Flask that serves the model.

## Project Structure

```
web-ml-app
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML file for the frontend
│   ├── css
│   │   └── style.css    # Styles for the frontend
│   └── js
│       └── script.js     # JavaScript code for user interactions
├── backend
│   ├── app.py           # Flask application for serving the model
│   ├── model.h5        # Trained machine learning model
│   └── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies for the backend
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-ml-app
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend:**
   - Open the `frontend/index.html` file in a web browser to access the application.

## Usage

- Interact with the frontend to input data for predictions.
- The frontend will communicate with the backend to retrieve predictions from the machine learning model.
