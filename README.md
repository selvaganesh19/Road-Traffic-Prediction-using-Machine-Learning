## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/selvaganesh19/Road-Traffic-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Road-Traffic-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
   ```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure your ML model file (e.g. model.pkl) is present in the backend directory
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
# Serve with your preferred static server, e.g.:
npx serve .
```

> **Tip:** For offline support and PWA features, make sure to run frontend from a web server!

---

## 📝 Usage

1. **Start the backend** by running `python app.py` in the `backend` directory.
2. **Serve the frontend** using a static server (e.g., `npx serve .` inside the `frontend` directory).
3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the frontend address (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or as served).
4. **Input required data** in the prediction form and click **Predict**.
5. **View traffic predictions and trend charts** instantly.
